# 2016 JCNK Hackathon C++ Club
Just a place for us to bolt together some code as part of training in our spare time.
## PKTriangle
A simple class which can be given either SideSideAngle or AngleAngleSide values, calculating the other values for you to give a triangle. To compile the included example, simply run:
```
g++ PKTriangle_Example.cpp PKTriangle.cpp -o PKTriangleExample -I .
```
this will build an executable `PKTriangleExample` which can be run from the command line.
